# PyTorch MNIST CNN
This is a PyTorch implementation of a CNN for the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to classify handwritten digits.

## Dependencies
PyTorch
torchvision
numpy
matplotlib

## Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs can be modified in the file.
You can also add or remove layers, change the number of filters, etc.

## Results
The model should achieve an accuracy of around 98% on the test dataset
The training process and accuracy will be shown in the output.
